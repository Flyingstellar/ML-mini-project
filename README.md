# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - A Data-Driven Approach to Smart Industry

This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. It's designed to showcase how data science and AI can power smart industry solutions.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the deployed web app:  
🔗 [Wine Quality Prediction App](https://winequality-tejas-shinde.streamlit.app)

## 📊 Problem Statement
The goal is to predict wine quality scores using various chemical properties of the wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, sulphates, etc. This can assist wineries and quality inspectors in automating quality assessment processes.

## 🔍 Features
- Interactive Streamlit web app for wine quality prediction  
- User-friendly input interface for testing different wine profiles  
- Real-time prediction using a trained machine learning model  
- Visualization of dataset insights (can be added in future updates)

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Backend / ML**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

## 🛠️ How it Works
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleansing and preparing data for training  
2. **Model Training** – Using algorithms like Random Forest and others to fit the model  
3. **Prediction** – Predicting wine quality score (typically 0–10 scale)  
4. **Deployment** – Streamlit app hosted for public access

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- Contains various attributes like:
  - Fixed acidity
  - Volatile acidity
  - Citric acid
  - Residual sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Free sulfur dioxide
  - Total sulfur dioxide
  - Density
  - pH
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol
  - Quality (target)

## 📷 Screenshots (Optional)
> Add screenshots of the app UI here for better presentation.

## 🧠 Future Scope
- Add support for white wine dataset  
- Improve model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning  
- Integrate visual EDA features into the web app  
- Enable model retraining on new data through UI
